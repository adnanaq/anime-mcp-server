## Current Tasks

### MCP Architecture Redesign (Platform-Specific Tools)

- [x] Design platform-specific MCP tools architecture with clear schemas

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Write unit tests for platform-specific MCP tools
- [ ] Write integration tests for LangGraph workflow orchestration
- [ ] Test tool chaining scenarios (MAL â†’ AnimeSchedule enrichment)
- [ ] Validate MCP schema compliance for all tools

### Complex Query Handling (From query.txt Analysis)

- [ ] Implement cross-platform data enrichment for rating comparisons (query #11, #44-48)
- [ ] Create cross-platform anime correlation system (link same anime across platforms)
- [ ] Enhance temporal query processing ("tomorrow", "last week", "5 years ago")
- [ ] Implement enhanced context memory for vague/partial descriptions
- [ ] Create workflow chaining for complex multi-step queries (#16, #51-55)
- [ ] Add real-time data validation and freshness checking
- [ ] Implement fuzzy matching for incomplete anime descriptions (#24, #58-62)
- [ ] Create likelihood ranking system for ambiguous queries
- [ ] Enhance semantic search for narrative elements (art style, music, themes)
- [ ] Implement cross-platform verification tools (#63-67)

### Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Update documentation with new architecture and tool chaining examples
- [ ] Create usage examples for complex tool chaining scenarios
- [ ] Document best practices for platform-specific tool selection

### Ultra-Specific Query Support

- [ ] Add precise temporal scheduling queries (exact JST times, etc.)
- [ ] Implement trending data correlation across platforms
- [ ] Create advanced filtering for complex narrative requirements
- [ ] Add support for discrepancy detection between platforms
- [ ] Implement historical context tracking ("anime I watched years ago")
