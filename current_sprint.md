# Sprint History & Current Progress

## Completed Phases (1-6A) - Production Ready System

### Core Foundation & Performance
- **Phase 1**: FastAPI + Marqo vector foundation (38,894 anime entries)
- **Phase 2**: Migration to Qdrant (4x performance improvement, <50ms search)
- **Phase 3**: FastMCP integration (8 MCP tools + 2 resources, JSON-RPC protocol)
- **Phase 4**: Multi-modal image search (CLIP embeddings, text+image vectors)
- **Phase 5**: Dual protocol support (stdio + HTTP transports)
- **Phase 6A**: LangGraph workflow orchestration (conversational intelligence layer)

### Key Technical Achievements
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant multi-vector collection (text: 384-dim, image: 512-dim)
- **Search Performance**: <200ms text search, ~1s image search response times
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated updates with intelligent scheduling and safety checks
- **MCP Protocol**: 8 tools including image search, dual transport support
- **Multi-Modal**: CLIP-powered visual similarity and combined text+image search
- **Conversational AI**: LangGraph workflow engine with 5-node pipeline
- **Production Infrastructure**: Docker orchestration, health monitoring, comprehensive API

### Architecture Excellence
```yaml
System Stack:
  - FastAPI + Qdrant + FastMCP + CLIP + LangGraph
  - 38,894 anime entries with full metadata
  - Multi-vector search (semantic + visual)
  - Dual MCP protocols (stdio + HTTP)
  - Conversational workflow orchestration
  - Docker deployment with auto-updates
```

## Phase 6A: LangGraph Integration (COMPLETED)

**Status**: Production ready with 64/64 tests passing (100% success rate)

### Completed Features
- **LangGraph Workflow Engine**: 5-node pipeline (start → understand → search → reasoning → synthesis → response)
- **MCP Tool Adapter Layer**: All 8 existing MCP tools accessible via adapter pattern
- **Type-Safe State Management**: Pydantic models for conversation state and workflow steps
- **FastAPI Integration**: 6 new `/api/workflow/*` endpoints for conversation management
- **Conversation Continuity**: Session-based state persistence with preference learning
- **Multimodal Workflows**: Text + image conversation capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Robust parameter validation and graceful error recovery

### Key Fixes Applied
- **MCP Client Initialization**: Fixed Qdrant client sharing between FastAPI and MCP tools
- **Parameter Unpacking**: Fixed adapter to use `**parameters` instead of dictionary passing
- **None Value Handling**: Fixed year comparison errors in reasoning node
- **Test Coverage**: Updated 64 tests to reflect all changes with 100% pass rate

### Architecture Achievements
- **Hybrid Design**: Preserved existing <200ms performance while adding intelligence
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality maintained
- **Real Database Integration**: Connected to 38,894 anime entries with full functionality
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Future Phases (Phase 6B+)

### Phase 6B: Smart Orchestration Workflows (PLANNED)
- Advanced conversational discovery with multi-step refinement
- Complex query chaining with intelligent tool orchestration  
- Enhanced multi-modal conversation flows
- Advanced user preference learning and adaptation

### Phase 6C: Specialized Agents & Analytics (PLANNED)
- Genre-expert agents and studio-focused discovery
- Comparative analysis and trend analytics workflows
- Streaming responses and performance optimization
- Multi-agent coordination patterns

## Current Architecture

### Proven Hybrid Design
```python
# Fast path for simple queries (PRESERVED)
GET /api/search/?q=naruto → Direct MCP tool → <200ms response

# Intelligent path for complex workflows (NEW)  
POST /api/workflow/conversation → LangGraph agent → Multi-step process → <3s response
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Simple Searches**: <200ms response times maintained
- **Complex Workflows**: <3s response time for multi-step processes
- **Database**: Zero migration risk, all existing performance preserved
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility with existing functionality
