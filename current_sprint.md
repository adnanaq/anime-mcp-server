# Sprint History & Current Progress

## Completed Phases (1-6A) - Production Ready System

### Core Foundation & Performance
- **Phase 1**: FastAPI + Marqo vector foundation (38,894 anime entries)
- **Phase 2**: Migration to Qdrant (4x performance improvement, <50ms search)
- **Phase 3**: FastMCP integration (8 MCP tools + 2 resources, JSON-RPC protocol)
- **Phase 4**: Multi-modal image search (CLIP embeddings, text+image vectors)
- **Phase 5**: Dual protocol support (stdio + HTTP transports)
- **Phase 6A**: LangGraph workflow orchestration (conversational intelligence layer)

### Key Technical Achievements
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant multi-vector collection (text: 384-dim, image: 512-dim)
- **Search Performance**: <200ms text search, ~1s image search response times
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated updates with intelligent scheduling and safety checks
- **MCP Protocol**: 8 tools including image search, dual transport support
- **Multi-Modal**: CLIP-powered visual similarity and combined text+image search
- **Conversational AI**: LangGraph workflow engine with 5-node pipeline
- **Production Infrastructure**: Docker orchestration, health monitoring, comprehensive API

### Architecture Excellence
```yaml
System Stack:
  - FastAPI + Qdrant + FastMCP + CLIP + LangGraph

- **Smart Query Orchestration**: Complex query decomposition with intelligent tool selection
- **Result Refinement Engine**: Multi-iteration improvement with quality filtering and expansion
- **MCP Tool Adapter Layer**: All 8 existing MCP tools accessible via adapter pattern
- **Advanced Conversation Flows**: Multi-stage discovery, refinement, and exploration workflows
- **Adaptive Preference Learning**: Dynamic user preference extraction and adaptation
- **Smart Orchestration State**: Extended state management with query chains and flow management
- **Enhanced Multimodal Processing**: Intelligent text+image workflow orchestration
- **Complex Query Assessment**: Automatic complexity detection for orchestration strategies
- **Type-Safe State Management**: Pydantic models for conversation state and workflow steps
- **FastAPI Integration**: 7 workflow endpoints including `/api/workflow/smart-conversation`
- **Conversation Continuity**: Session-based state persistence with preference learning
- **Error Handling**: Robust parameter validation and graceful error recovery

### Technical Achievements
- **Hybrid Design**: Preserved existing <200ms performance while adding intelligence
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality maintained
- **Real Database Integration**: Connected to 38,894 anime entries with full functionality
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and end-to-end testing validation
- **Performance**: Smart orchestration actually faster (50ms) than standard workflows (74ms)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation completed

## Future Phases (Phase 6C+)

### Phase 6C: Specialized Agents & Analytics (PLANNED)
- Genre-expert agents and studio-focused discovery
- Comparative analysis and trend analytics workflows
- Streaming responses and performance optimization
- Multi-agent coordination patterns

## Current Architecture

### Proven Hybrid Design
```python
# Fast path for simple queries (PRESERVED)
GET /api/search/?q=naruto → Direct MCP tool → <200ms response

# Intelligent path for complex workflows (NEW)  
POST /api/workflow/conversation → LangGraph agent → Multi-step process → <3s response
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Simple Searches**: <200ms response times maintained
- **Complex Workflows**: <3s response time for multi-step processes
- **Database**: Zero migration risk, all existing performance preserved
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility with existing functionality
