            "description": "__Height:__ 176cm (5'9)\n\nA Japanese actor, voice actor, singer and narrator from Shiogama, Miyagi Prefecture. He graduated from Tohoku Gakuin University's economics school and is currently affiliated with Across Entertainment.\n\nHe was the manager of the Tagajou Senior High School basketball team before he made a name for himself. His voice acting debut was the OVA [Megazone 23](https://anilist.co/anime/1935/) as the motorcycle-riding [Shinji Nakagawa](https://anilist.co/character/56633/), while his television debut was the anime [Bosco Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/3460/) as the cowardly Otter. His break-out role, however, was in the anime [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), in which he played the dual role of [Hibiki Ryoga](https://anilist.co/character/2369/) and the [Jusenkyo Guide](https://anilist.co/character/58321/). In 1991, Yamadera joined forces with [Toshihiko Seki](https://anilist.co/staff/95129/) and [Noriko Hidaka](https://anilist.co/staff/95181/) to form the acting unit Banana Fritters, which disbanded in 1995. In October 1997, Yamadera became a host on the TV Tokyo children's variety show Oha Suta. In March 2016, after almost two decades, he announced his retirement from it.\n\nYamadera's also known for his versatile range, as shown in the video game Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony where he voiced all five Monokuma Kubs, including Monophanie (female). According to the Danganronpa V3 official blog, Yamadera is the first person who came to mind as \"the same person voicing multiple characters at the same time\". No one has as much \"multiple characters\" experience as him. He was able to take the individual quirks of each of the Monokuma Kubs and make all of them unique.\n\nOther notable examples of multiple voice acting include the Kingdom Hearts series where he voiced Donald Duck, Genie (Aladdin), Sebastian (The Little Mermaid), Beast (Beauty and the Beast), Mushu (Mulan), Jaq (Cinderella) and Stitch (Lilo and Stitch), and the [Japan Animator Expo](https://anilist.co/anime/20947/) series of 35 short films where Yamadera and [Megumi Hayashibara](https://anilist.co/staff/95014/) voiced all characters.\n\nYamadera was married to fellow voice actresses [Mika Kanai](https://anilist.co/staff/95029/) from 1993 to 2006, and to [Rie Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/95060/) from 2012 to 2018. On June 14, 2021, his marriage to singer and idol Robin Shoko Okada was announced.\n\n__Trivia:__\n- His nickname is Yama-chan.\n- The official dub-over voice for Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey and Disney's Donald Duck.\n- He didn't consider to do voice acting at first and was more interested in being either a live-action actor or a salesman.\n- He is known as \"the man with the seven-colored voice\".\n- In 2011 and 2017, TV Asahi conducted a poll among Japanese voice actors and actresses on \"who they thought was really the most amazing person in their profession\". Yamadera ranked first both times.",

          "description": "Jet, known on his home satellite as the \"Black Dog\" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).  Jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).  ~!During the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.  In a later episode, another Vicious/Spike parallel is set up when Jet finds out that it was his old partner Fad who betrayed him (though in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved). Fad arranged for Jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. It is worth noting that Jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to Spike, who was killed when he confronted his. This is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. While Spike hid and fled from his past, Jet tracked it down and confronted it.!~",

          "description": "One of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.  \n\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners’ sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.",

          "description": "Ein is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi brought aboard the Bebop by Spike after a failed attempt to capture a bounty. Ein is a \"data dog\": while the televised series only briefly hints on the fact that this means Ein's brain was somehow enhanced drastically, the manga shows Ed accessing data stored in Ein's brain via a virtual reality-type interface with which she has a conversation with a human proprietor. It is obvious that Ein is abnormally intelligent, as he is able to answer the telephone, drive a car (just the wheel), use the SSW, play shōgi, and generally do a number of other things that an average canine should not be able to do, but he never talks in a human language during the show. He does, however, speak in Session 18 \"Speak Like A Child\" after the credits Ein tells Spike \"Next Episode: Wild Horses\". He is able to \"speak\" to other species, as demonstrated in Session 17, \"Mushroom Samba\" (he spoke to a cow with a subtitled bark of \"Thanks\", to which the cow has a subtitled moo back of \"No problem\"). It is likely that Ed is the only crew member with any idea of Ein's capabilities, as the other crew members are quick to dismiss Ein, and never seem to acknowledge him as more than a pet. Ein initially takes a shine to Jet, but when Ed joins the crew, he comes around to her as well. Frequently the two trade roles, with Ein expressing very human sentiments via facial expression and Ed regressing to a feral state. He went with Ed after she left the crew, probably because of his attachment to her. His name is a pun on the Japanese word for \"dog\" (犬 inu) but is also German for \"one\". \"Ein\" may also be short for \"Einstein\", after Albert Einstein, because of the extraordinary intelligence he possesses.",

            "description": "__Height:__ 176cm (5'9)\n\nA Japanese actor, voice actor, singer and narrator from Shiogama, Miyagi Prefecture. He graduated from Tohoku Gakuin University's economics school and is currently affiliated with Across Entertainment.\n\nHe was the manager of the Tagajou Senior High School basketball team before he made a name for himself. His voice acting debut was the OVA [Megazone 23](https://anilist.co/anime/1935/) as the motorcycle-riding [Shinji Nakagawa](https://anilist.co/character/56633/), while his television debut was the anime [Bosco Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/3460/) as the cowardly Otter. His break-out role, however, was in the anime [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), in which he played the dual role of [Hibiki Ryoga](https://anilist.co/character/2369/) and the [Jusenkyo Guide](https://anilist.co/character/58321/). In 1991, Yamadera joined forces with [Toshihiko Seki](https://anilist.co/staff/95129/) and [Noriko Hidaka](https://anilist.co/staff/95181/) to form the acting unit Banana Fritters, which disbanded in 1995. In October 1997, Yamadera became a host on the TV Tokyo children's variety show Oha Suta. In March 2016, after almost two decades, he announced his retirement from it.\n\nYamadera's also known for his versatile range, as shown in the video game Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony where he voiced all five Monokuma Kubs, including Monophanie (female). According to the Danganronpa V3 official blog, Yamadera is the first person who came to mind as \"the same person voicing multiple characters at the same time\". No one has as much \"multiple characters\" experience as him. He was able to take the individual quirks of each of the Monokuma Kubs and make all of them unique.\n\nOther notable examples of multiple voice acting include the Kingdom Hearts series where he voiced Donald Duck, Genie (Aladdin), Sebastian (The Little Mermaid), Beast (Beauty and the Beast), Mushu (Mulan), Jaq (Cinderella) and Stitch (Lilo and Stitch), and the [Japan Animator Expo](https://anilist.co/anime/20947/) series of 35 short films where Yamadera and [Megumi Hayashibara](https://anilist.co/staff/95014/) voiced all characters.\n\nYamadera was married to fellow voice actresses [Mika Kanai](https://anilist.co/staff/95029/) from 1993 to 2006, and to [Rie Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/95060/) from 2012 to 2018. On June 14, 2021, his marriage to singer and idol Robin Shoko Okada was announced.\n\n__Trivia:__\n- His nickname is Yama-chan.\n- The official dub-over voice for Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey and Disney's Donald Duck.\n- He didn't consider to do voice acting at first and was more interested in being either a live-action actor or a salesman.\n- He is known as \"the man with the seven-colored voice\".\n- In 2011 and 2017, TV Asahi conducted a poll among Japanese voice actors and actresses on \"who they thought was really the most amazing person in their profession\". Yamadera ranked first both times.",

            "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nKeiji Fujiwara was a Japanese actor and voice actor.\n\nEven though he was born in Tokyo, he spent the majority of his childhood in Iwate Prefecture. In high school, he handled vocals in a band he formed with his friend Kotaro Furuichi, future guitarist of rock band The Collectors.\n\nAt around 18 years of age, he moved back to Tokyo on his own and joined the Bungakuza acting school. He spent the 1980s performing in several theater troupes while working odd jobs. Fujiwara was introduced to his first voice acting agency, Ken Production, in the early 1990s. The first TV anime in which he appeared as a regular was [Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/970/), but his breakout role was [Hiroshi Nohara](https://anilist.co/character/33466/) in [Crayon Shin-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/966/).\n\nIn November 2006, he left Ken Production and founded his own agency, Air Agency. Aside from talent management, the company went on to release original drama and situation CDs through its child company Air Label, as well as produce live events. In 2010, Fujiwara made his own sound directorial debut in Kakkokawaii Sengen.\n\nIn August 2016, Air Agency announced that he was going on hiatus in order to undergo medical treatment for a then-unspecified illness. He officially resumed work in June 2017. On April 16, 2020, Air Agency announced that Fujiwara had passed away due to cancer on April 12, 2020.\n\n__Trivia:__\n- He was a regular lecturer at the Japan Newart College since 2008\n- In the live action field, he was most known for dubbing actor Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man/Tony Stark.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Following a conflict with a group of space raiders, Giraffe was found blindfolded in a silo, presumably betrayed by his partner, Zebra. The Bebop crew later began tracking Giraffe, who was a 3 million Woolong bounty head. Giraffe, meanwhile, is trailing Zebra and Wen, and follows them to a sky rise hotel. After an unseen altercation, Giraffe goes crashing through the window, being caught by Spike Spiegel's Swordfish II.",

The plan was to acquire a special chip (with the ability to decrypt and unlock virtually any security code) from one of the patrons in Gordon's casino, but the plan goes awry due to the intervention of Spike Spiegel. Gordon makes an arrangement with Spike and Jet Black to exchange the chip, currently in the hands of Spike and Jet, for 30 million Woolongs. Gordon and his henchmen intend to turn on them, but are quickly outwitted.",

However, she became increasingly unsatisfied, as she felt she had no independence outside of their relationship. One day, she decided she had to end it and left Jet, leaving for him a watch and a note that simply said, \"Farewell.\"\n\nAlisa started to run a bar called La Fin by 2071. However, business became slow as the area was much less trafficked than it used to be. Alisa decided to take out a loan with Law Rentzuo in order to keep the bar open.\n\n(Source: Cowboy Bebop Fandom Wikia)",

During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/). Some of the more recent works he has provided designs for include [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/), [Ghost Slayers Ayashi](https://anilist.co/anime/1587/), [Noragami](https://anilist.co/anime/20447/) and [Kekkai Sensen](https://anilist.co/anime/20727/).\n\n**Non-anime staff credits:**\n~!\n- Character Design - \"Gigantic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam A year of War\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91 Formula Senki 0122\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Return of Zion\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Senki\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE Be Eliminate Yesterday\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Wonder Project J\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Robot Alchemic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Assistant Chief Animation Director - \"OVER THE MONOCHROME RAINBOW\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation for \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam PERFECT ONE YEAR WAR\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Serial Experiments Lain\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Spiral Zone\" (ep 5)!~",

          "description": "Shouji Kawamori is an anime creator, director and mechanical designer. Also a current advisor for [Satelight](https://anilist.co/studio/41/).\n\nFamous for his work in the [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) and Transformers franchises. He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",

She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

Also the leading producer of its Studio B.\n\nAfter graduating from Osaka University of Arts, Minami joined [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/) in 1984. There he did desk work and served as a production assistant on many of [Masuo Ueda](https://anilist.co/staff/148840/)'s productions. He was promoted to producer on [Musha Knight Commando](https://anilist.co/anime/9087/) in 1991, and from there he went on to produce shows such as [Mobile Fighter G Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/96/), [Vision of Escaflowne](https://anilist.co/anime/182/) and [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/). In 1998, he left Sunrise and established Bones with [Toshihiro Kawamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/103531/) and the late [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/). He was elected as the representative director of the studio and has held the position since.\n\nMinami's classmates at university included [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), [Hiroyuki Yamaga](https://anilist.co/staff/100988/), and [Kazuhiko Shimamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/97479/). He appears as a character in the manga [Aoi Honoo](https://anilist.co/manga/55292/), which Shimamoto wrote about his own university days. The manga also received a TV drama adaptation, in which Minami was portrayed by actor Kaname Endou.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Steve Conte (pronounced /ˈkoʊnt/) is a member and the lead singer of the band The Contes along with his brother John Conte. He is also the lead singer of Crown Jewels, and is the current lead guitarist of the New York Dolls. In his youth, Steve was the lead guitarist and backing singer in the band Waddi And The Waddettes. Conte first became known to the music industry through his band Company of Wolves (Mercury Records) in the early 1990s. Steve has done studio and/or live work with artists like Peter Wolf, Willy DeVille, Maceo Parker, Billy Squier, Suzi Quatro, Jill Jones, Paul Simon, Simon & Garfunkel, Phoebe Snow, David Johansen & The Harry Smiths, Chuck Berry, Willie Nile and many others. Conte occasionally plays guitar with Eric Burdon & The Animals.    He has also worked with composer Yoko Kanno and lyricist Tim Jensen in music for several anime series. Steve Conte sang the opening theme, Stray, to the Studio BONES' anime series Wolf's Rain as well as the tracks Heaven's Not Enough and Could You Bite the Hand? on both of the anime's soundtracks. Conte can also be heard in some episodes of Cowboy Bebop, most notably for the song Call Me Call Me, as well as Words That We Couldn't Say, No Reply, and the CD version of Rain, sung by Mai Yamane in the series. More recently, he sang the ending theme to Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG; Living Inside the Shell alongside with Shanti Snyder. He also performed on the duet \"The Garden of Everything\" with Japanese singer Maaya Sakamoto on her RahXephon-related single \"Tune the Rainbow\".    He most recently provided the vocals for the video game Sonic and the Secret Rings closing credits song titled Worth a Chance, and the game's main theme Seven Rings In Hand. Songs which did not make the final soundtrack of the game include Midget In A Rocket and Lute To A Cow.    Currently, Conte is planning another tour, during 2009, as evidenced by a poster he left on the MySpace website for Deborah Harry (lead singer of the band Blondie).    ",

He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",

During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/).

          "description": "A co-founder and a board member of [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/).\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Kawamoto was first employed in the making and designing of precision machinery. During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/). Some of the more recent works he has provided designs for include [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/), [Ghost Slayers Ayashi](https://anilist.co/anime/1587/), [Noragami](https://anilist.co/anime/20447/) and [Kekkai Sensen](https://anilist.co/anime/20727/).\n\n**Non-anime staff credits:**\n~!\n- Character Design - \"Gigantic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam A year of War\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91 Formula Senki 0122\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Return of Zion\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Senki\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE Be Eliminate Yesterday\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Wonder Project J\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Robot Alchemic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Assistant Chief Animation Director - \"OVER THE MONOCHROME RAINBOW\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation for \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam PERFECT ONE YEAR WAR\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Serial Experiments Lain\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Spiral Zone\" (ep 5)!~",

After switching several studios; from Art Office Sharaku, to Anime Torotoro, to [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), he eventually settled at [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/) with a contract.\n\nNakamura is considered to be among the best action animators, with his scenes featuring catchy movement and effects. Some of his recognizable traits include camera shaking, blurs, and bending and stretching high-speed objects. His fights are praised for its weighty, intense choreographies that are heavy on impact frames. His signature trait is drawing debris as simple cubes, consequentially named \"Yutapon Cubes,\" which are stylistic and easy to draw. Despite being responsible for popularizing it, Nakamura has stated that he started doing it when he noticed [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) doing it. \n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",

There he took part in many of [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/)'s productions. During the '80s, he became one of the big-name animators that helped shape the industry, alongside names like [Hiroyuki Okiura](https://anilist.co/staff/103502/), [Kazuchika Kise](https://anilist.co/staff/115781/) and [Masahiro Kase](https://anilist.co/staff/153351/). After having left Anime R in 1991, he mainly kept working on Sunrise's works as a freelancer.\n\nIn 1998, he was involved in the establishment of [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/), a studio which he then joined as a key member. Ousaka has also been involved in productions with [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/), which was still a sub-contracting studio at the time, where he helped train the studio's young animators.\n\nOusaka passed away from cancer on September 24, 2007.",

          "description": "A co-founder and a board member of [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/).\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Kawamoto was first employed in the making and designing of precision machinery. During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/). Some of the more recent works he has provided designs for include [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/), [Ghost Slayers Ayashi](https://anilist.co/anime/1587/), [Noragami](https://anilist.co/anime/20447/) and [Kekkai Sensen](https://anilist.co/anime/20727/).\n\n**Non-anime staff credits:**\n~!\n- Character Design - \"Gigantic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam A year of War\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91 Formula Senki 0122\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Return of Zion\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Senki\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE Be Eliminate Yesterday\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Wonder Project J\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Robot Alchemic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Assistant Chief Animation Director - \"OVER THE MONOCHROME RAINBOW\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation for \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam PERFECT ONE YEAR WAR\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Serial Experiments Lain\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Spiral Zone\" (ep 5)!~",
