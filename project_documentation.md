> ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DO NOT MODIFY STRUCTURE
>
> This file is a standardized project documentation to give context and structure to your project.
>
> Replace only **placeholder values** (e.g., `[YYYY-MM-DD]`, `[Description]`, `[List tasks]`, etc.) during the sprint.
>
> **DO NOT remove**, rename, or reorder **sections**, **sub-section**, **tables**, **field**, **headers**, **chekclist**, **format** etc
>
> If a field is **not applicable or not yet filled**, **keep the placeholder** (e.g., `[None this sprint]`, `[To be determined]`) and **do not delete the section**.
>
> This ensures compatibility with automation, agentic AI tools, and manual reviews.
