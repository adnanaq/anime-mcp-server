```

---

TITLE: Recommended Pattern for Registering Instance Methods with FastMCP
DESCRIPTION: This example demonstrates the correct approach for integrating instance methods with FastMCP. Instead of direct decoration, an instance of the class (`obj`) is created first. By accessing the method through the instance (`obj.add`), Python creates a bound method where `self` is already set. Registering this bound method ensures that the system sees a callable that only expects the appropriate parameters, effectively hiding `self` from the LLM.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/patterns/decorating-methods.mdx#_snippet_2

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP()

class MyClass:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y

# Create an instance first, then register the bound methods
obj = MyClass()
mcp.tool(obj.add)

# Now you can call it without 'self' showing up as a parameter
await mcp._mcp_call_tool('add', {'x': 1, 'y': 2})  # Returns 3
```

TITLE: FastMCP: Excluding Routes by Pattern or Tag
DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates how to explicitly exclude routes from the FastMCP server. It uses `RouteMap` with `MCPType.EXCLUDE` to prevent routes matching the `/admin/` pattern or those tagged 'internal' from being processed. This is useful for removing sensitive or internal API endpoints.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/servers/openapi.mdx#_snippet_4

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    ...,
    route_maps=[
        RouteMap(pattern=r"^/admin/.*", mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE),
        RouteMap(tags={"internal"}, mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE),
    ],
)
```

TITLE: FastMCP: Catch-All Rule for Route Exclusion
DESCRIPTION: This example shows how to implement a catch-all exclusion rule in FastMCP route mapping. By placing a `RouteMap` with `MCPType.EXCLUDE` at the end of the `route_maps` list, all routes not explicitly handled by preceding custom maps will be excluded. This effectively creates an allow-list approach for route processing.

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    ...,
    route_maps=[
        # custom mapping logic goes here
        ...,
        # exclude all remaining routes
        RouteMap(mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE),
    ],
)

# The original, generic tool
@mcp.tool
def search(query: str, category: str = "all") -> list[dict]:
    """Searches for items in the database."""
    return database.search(query, category)

# Create a more domain-specific version by changing its metadata
product_search_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    search,
    name="find_products",
    description="""
        Search for products in the e-commerce catalog.
        Use this when customers ask about finding specific items,
        checking availability, or browsing product categories.

---

TITLE: Incorrect Direct Decoration of Instance Methods: Unbound Method Issue
DESCRIPTION: This snippet illustrates a common mistake: directly decorating an instance method (`add`) with `@mcp.tool`. When the decorator is applied this way, it captures the unbound method. Consequently, when an LLM attempts to use this component, it will incorrectly perceive `self` as a required parameter, leading to errors or unexpected behavior because it cannot provide a value for `self`.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/patterns/decorating-methods.mdx#_snippet_1

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP()

class MyClass:
    @mcp.tool  # This won't work correctly
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y
```

---

TITLE: Registering Static Methods with FastMCP (Recommended Pattern)
DESCRIPTION: This preferred pattern shows how to register a static method with FastMCP by first defining it as a static method and then explicitly registering it using `mcp.tool(MyClass.utility)`. This ensures proper method binding and is the recommended approach.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/patterns/decorating-methods.mdx#_snippet_6

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP()

class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def utility(x, y):
        return x + y

# This also works
mcp.tool(MyClass.utility)
```

---

TITLE: Registering FastMCP Tools and Resources with MCPMixin in Python
DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates how to define a class `MyComponent` that inherits from `MCPMixin` to register its methods as `FastMCP` tools and resources. It uses `@mcp_tool` and `@mcp_resource` decorators to mark methods for registration. The `register_all()` method is then called on an instance of `MyComponent` to register these methods with a `FastMCP` server, optionally using a `prefix` to avoid naming collisions.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/contrib/mcp_mixin/README.md#_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: Python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.contrib.mcp_mixin import MCPMixin, mcp_tool, mcp_resource

class MyComponent(MCPMixin):
    @mcp_tool(name="my_tool", description="Does something cool.")
    def tool_method(self):
        return "Tool executed!"

    @mcp_resource(uri="component://data")
    def resource_method(self):
        return {"data": "some data"}

mcp_server = FastMCP()
component = MyComponent()

# Register all decorated methods with a prefix
# Useful if you will have multiple instantiated objects of the same class
# and want to avoid name collisions.
component.register_all(mcp_server, prefix="my_comp")

# Register without a prefix
# component.register_all(mcp_server)

# Now 'my_comp_my_tool' tool and 'my_comp+component://data' resource are registered (if prefix used)
# Or 'my_tool' and 'component://data' are registered (if no prefix used)
```

LANGUAGE: Python
CODE:

```
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        # A remote HTTP server
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather-api.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "streamable-http"
        },
        # A local server running via stdio
        "assistant": {
            "command": "python",

async with Client("https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", auth=oauth) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

---

TITLE: Connect to FastMCP Server via In-Memory Transport
DESCRIPTION: Shows how to connect directly to a `fastmcp.server.FastMCP` instance within the same Python process using `fastmcp.client.transports.FastMCPTransport`. This method is highly efficient due to in-memory queues and is ideal for testing FastMCP servers. The transport is automatically inferred from a `FastMCP` server instance.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/clients/transports.mdx#_snippet_15

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
import asyncio

# 1. Create your FastMCP server instance
server = FastMCP(name="InMemoryServer")

@server.tool
def ping():
    return "pong"

# 2. Create a client pointing directly to the server instance
client = Client(server)  # Transport is automatically inferred

async def main():
    async with client:
        result = await client.call_tool("ping")
        print(f"In-memory call result: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

# Create transport with authentication headers
transport = StreamableHttpTransport(
    url="https://example.com/mcp",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here"}
)

client = Client(transport)
```

---

TITLE: Configuring Direct vs. Proxy Mounting in FastMCP
DESCRIPTION: Illustrates the two modes of mounting in FastMCP: direct and proxy. Direct mounting is the default and accesses objects in memory, while proxy mounting treats the mounted server as a separate entity, preserving its full client lifecycle.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/servers/composition.mdx#_snippet_3

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
# Direct mounting (default when no custom lifespan)
main_mcp.mount("api", api_server)

# Proxy mounting (preserves full client lifecycle)
main_mcp.mount("api", api_server, as_proxy=True)
```

---

TITLE: Run a FastMCP server from the command line
DESCRIPTION: This command-line snippet shows how to execute a FastMCP server defined in a Python file (e.g., 'server.py'). The 'fastmcp run' command starts the server, making its defined tools and resources accessible.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/README.md#_snippet_1

LANGUAGE: bash
CODE:

```
fastmcp run server.py
```

---

TITLE: Accessing Resources in FastMCP Tools
DESCRIPTION: Explains how to read data from resources registered with the FastMCP server using `ctx.read_resource`. This enables functions to access files, configuration, or dynamically generated content. The content is typically accessed via `content_list[0].content` and can be text or binary data.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/servers/context.mdx#_snippet_6

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
@mcp.tool
async def summarize_document(document_uri: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Summarize a document by its resource URI."""
    # Read the document content
    content_list = await ctx.read_resource(document_uri)

    if not content_list:
        return "Document is empty"

    document_text = content_list[0].content

    # Example: Generate a simple summary (length-based)
    words = document_text.split()
    total_words = len(words)

    await ctx.info(f"Document has {total_words} words")

    # Return a simple summary
    if total_words > 100:
        summary = " ".join(words[:100]) + "..."
        return f"Summary ({total_words} words total): {summary}"
    else:
        return f"Full document ({total_words} words): {document_text}"
```

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:

```
ctx.read_resource(uri: str | AnyUrl) -> list[ReadResourceContents]
  uri: The resource URI to read
  Returns a list of resource content parts (usually containing just one item)
```

---

TITLE: Define FastMCP Resource Templates with URI Parameters
DESCRIPTION: This example illustrates how to create dynamic resource templates in FastMCP using the `@mcp.resource` decorator. It demonstrates defining templates with single and multiple URI placeholders (e.g., `{city}`, `{owner}/{repo}`), which map directly to function arguments, enabling on-demand resource generation based on client requests.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/servers/resources.mdx#_snippet_10

LANGUAGE: Python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

# Template URI includes {city} placeholder
@mcp.resource("weather://{city}/current")
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Provides weather information for a specific city."""
    # In a real implementation, this would call a weather API
    # Here we're using simplified logic for example purposes
    return {
        "city": city.capitalize(),
        "temperature": 22,
        "condition": "Sunny",
        "unit": "celsius"
    }

# Template with multiple parameters
@mcp.resource("repos://{owner}/{repo}/info")
def get_repo_info(owner: str, repo: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves information about a GitHub repository."""
    # In a real implementation, this would call the GitHub API
    return {
        "owner": owner,
        "name": repo,
        "full_name": f"{owner}/{repo}",
        "stars": 120,
        "forks": 48
    }
```

---

TITLE: Disabling Original Tool After Transformation in fastmcp
DESCRIPTION: This Python example illustrates the best practice of disabling the original tool after creating a transformed version using `Tool.from_tool()`. By calling `search.disable()`, you prevent the LLM from being confused by two similar tools, ensuring it only interacts with the newly enhanced `product_search_tool`.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/patterns/tool-transformation.mdx#_snippet_1

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool

mcp = FastMCP()

# The original, generic tool
@mcp.tool
def search(query: str, category: str = "all") -> list[dict]:
    ...

# Create a more domain-specific version
product_search_tool = Tool.from_tool(search, ...)
mcp.add_tool(product_search_tool)

# Disable the original tool
search.disable()
```

---

TITLE: Recommended Pattern for Registering Class Methods with FastMCP
DESCRIPTION: This example demonstrates the correct method for registering class methods with FastMCP. The `@classmethod` decorator is applied normally during class definition. After the class is defined, the class method is registered using `mcp.tool(MyClass.from_string)`. This approach ensures that Python properly handles the `cls` parameter internally, exposing only the relevant parameters to the LLM and preventing unexpected behavior.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/patterns/decorating-methods.mdx#_snippet_4

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP()

class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, s):
        return cls(s)

# Register the class method after the class is defined
mcp.tool(MyClass.from_string)
```

TITLE: Demonstrating Incorrect Direct Decoration of Instance Methods
DESCRIPTION: This example shows why directly applying a FastMCP decorator like `@mcp.tool` to an instance method is problematic. The decorator returns a `Tool` object, replacing the original method, which makes it uncallable by Python code and prevents LLMs from properly interacting with it due to the exposed `self` parameter.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/patterns/decorating-methods.mdx#_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP
mcp = FastMCP()

class MyClass:
    @mcp.tool
    def my_method(self, x: int) -> int:
        return x * 2

obj = MyClass()
obj.my_method(5)  # Fails - my_method is a Tool, not a function
```

---

TITLE: Managing Client Sessions with `keep_alive` in FastMCP (Python)

---

TITLE: Incorrect Direct Decoration of Class Methods: Decorator Order Matters
DESCRIPTION: This snippet highlights the pitfalls of directly decorating class methods with FastMCP, emphasizing that decorator order is crucial. If `@classmethod` is applied before `@mcp.tool`, no error is raised, but the method won't function correctly. Conversely, if `@mcp.tool` is applied first, FastMCP will detect the issue and raise a helpful `ValueError`, preventing silent failures. Both scenarios expose `cls` to the LLM, leading to incorrect behavior.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/patterns/decorating-methods.mdx#_snippet_3

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP()

class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    @mcp.tool  # This won't work but won't raise an error
    def from_string_v1(cls, s):
        return cls(s)

    @mcp.tool
    @classmethod  # This will raise a helpful ValueError
    def from_string_v2(cls, s):
        return cls(s)
```

TITLE: FastMCP Array Parameter Serialization
DESCRIPTION: Explains how FastMCP serializes array parameters for both query and path segments according to OpenAPI specifications, including the effect of the `explode` parameter for query arrays.
SOURCE: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/servers/openapi.mdx#_snippet_13

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:

```
# Query array with explode=true (default)
# ?tags=red&tags=blue&tags=green

# Query array with explode=false
# ?tags=red,blue,green

# Path array (always comma-separated)
# /items/red,blue,green
```
