## 5. Plan the Work

- Ultrathink and Analyze, and Break down the problem into small, actionable steps.
- Identify inputs, outputs, edge cases, and data dependencies.
- Consider which tools or workflows (e.g. LangGraph, MCP) will be involved.

## 6. Create a New Scratchpad

- Create a new file under `scratchpads/` using this format:  
  `scratchpads/<issue-slug>.md`
- In that file, include:
  - A link to the GitHub issue.
  - Summary of the problem.
  - The action plan (bullet-pointed task breakdown).
  - Any relevant code links, notes from previous scratchpads, or dependencies.
