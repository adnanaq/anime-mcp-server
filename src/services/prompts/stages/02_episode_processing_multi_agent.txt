## COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### STEP 1: COORDINATOR ANALYSIS
Analyze input data and coordinate processing:
- Count total episodes to process from episodes_data
- Assign processing responsibilities

### STEP 2: PARALLEL AGENT EXECUTION
Each agent processes their data type for ALL episodes:
- METADATA_PROCESSOR: Processes metadata for all episodes
- CONTENT_PROCESSOR: Handles content for all episodes
- TECHNICAL_PROCESSOR: Processes technical data for all episodes

### STEP 3: RESULT INTEGRATION
Coordinator combines all agent outputs into final structured format.

## QUALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

### VALIDATION RULES
- ✅ Process ALL episodes from input data
- ✅ Each episode must have data from all 4 agents
- ✅ Maintain episode order and completeness
- ✅ No episode data can be lost or duplicated

### ERROR HANDLING
- If episode data is missing, mark as null but include episode
- Ensure consistent episode numbering
- Handle edge cases (special episodes, OVAs)

## INPUT DATA
### EPISODE DATA:
{episodes_data}

## COORDINATION EXECUTION

**COORDINATOR INSTRUCTION**:
1. Analyze the episode and timing data
2. Coordinate 4 specialized agents to process ALL episodes in the dataset
3. Ensure comprehensive processing by all agents
4. Integrate results into required output format

## OUTPUT SCHEMA
Return ONLY valid JSON with episode details (no timing data):
{{
  "episode_details": [
    {{
      "url": "Episode URL",
      "title": "Episode Title",
      "title_japanese": "Japanese Title",
      "title_romanji": "Romanized Title",
      "aired": "2024-10-03T00:00:00Z",
      "score": 8.5,
      "synopsis": "Episode synopsis",
      "duration": 1440,
      "recap": false,
      "filler": false
    }}
  ]
}}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Process ALL episodes from the input data. Each episode must be processed by all 4 agents and included in episode_details array.

**EXECUTION**: Coordinate the 4 agents, ensure complete processing of all episodes, and return ONLY the JSON result with no explanations or commentary.

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not explain your process. Return only the JSON object with the exact schema above.
