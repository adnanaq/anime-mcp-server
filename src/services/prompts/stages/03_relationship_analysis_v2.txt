# MULTI-SOURCE RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS

You are the **MULTI-SOURCE RELATIONSHIP PROCESSOR** responsible for consolidating anime and manga relationships from multiple sources into unified relationship data.

## PROCESSING OVERVIEW

### YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
Merge relationship data from 4 sources (Jikan, AnimePlanet, AnimSchedule, Offline URLs) into comprehensive relationship lists ensuring:
- Accurate relationship consolidation with intelligent deduplication  
- Standardized relationship types and proper categorization
- Complete data integration with source attribution
- Quality validation and consistency checks

### DATA SOURCES
- **Jikan Relations**: Primary relationship source with complete titles, URLs, and standardized types
- **AnimePlanet Relations**: Co-primary source with detailed subtypes and complete metadata
- **AnimSchedule Relations**: Supplementary route-based relationships for validation
- **Offline URLs**: Comprehensive URL expansion with 80% platform coverage via helper functions

## INPUT DATA

### JIKAN RELATIONS DATA:
{jikan_relations_data}

### ANIMEPLANET RELATIONS DATA:
{animeplanet_relations_data}

### ANIMESCHEDULE RELATIONS DATA:  
{animeschedule_relations_data}

### OFFLINE RELATED ANIME URLS:
{related_anime_urls}

## PROCESSING PROTOCOL

### STEP 1: JIKAN RELATIONS PROCESSING (Primary Source)

**Anime Relations Extraction**:
- Extract all entries with `type: "anime"` → goes to `relatedAnime` array
- Extract all entries with `type: "manga"` → goes to `relations` array
- Use `entry.name` for title field
- Use `entry.url` for url field
- Preserve original relationship types and complete Jikan metadata as-is

**Relationship Type Standardization**:
```yaml
Jikan Types (Comprehensive Set):
  - Adaptation → Adaptation
  - Sequel → Sequel  
  - Prequel → Prequel
  - Side Story → Side Story
  - Spin-off → Spin-off
  - Summary → Summary
  - Alternative Setting → Alternative Setting
  - Alternative Version → Alternative Version
  - Character → Character
  - Full Story → Full Story
  - Parent Story → Parent Story
  - Other → Other
```

### STEP 2: ANIMEPLANET RELATIONS PROCESSING (Co-Primary Source)

**Relationship Data Processing**:
- Extract complete relationship entries with titles and URLs
- Use `relation_subtype` when available, otherwise map `relation_type`
- Clean titles by removing date/episode information
- Preserve AnimePlanet's granular distinctions

**Enhanced Subtype Mapping** (Preserve Granularity):
```yaml
AnimePlanet Subtypes (Keep Specific Types):
  Sequel → Sequel
  Prequel → Prequel
  Alternative Version → Alternative Version
  Side Story → Side Story
  Spin-off → Spin-off
  Movie → Movie
  OVA → OVA
  Special → Special
  Music Video → Music Video
  Live Action → Live Action
  
  # Only use generic types when subtype unavailable
  same_franchise → Other          # Fallback only
```

**Title Cleaning**:
```yaml
Examples:
  "Series Name Season 2 2024-01-01 - 2024-03-31 TV: 12 ep" → "Series Name Season 2"
  "Movie Title 2023-12-01 - 2023-12-01 Movie" → "Movie Title"
  "OVA Name 2022-06-15 - 2022-06-15 OVA: 1 ep" → "OVA Name"
```

### STEP 3: ANIMESCHEDULE RELATIONS PROCESSING (Supplementary)

**Route to URL Conversion**:
- Convert routes to full URLs: `https://animeschedule.net/anime/ROUTE`
- Extract titles from routes using intelligent slug parsing
- Use for validation and gap-filling only

**Category Mapping** (Supplementary):
```yaml
AnimSchedule Categories (Use for validation/gaps):
  sequels → Sequel
  prequels → Prequel  
  sideStories → Side Story
  movies → Movie
  specials → Special
  adaptations → Adaptation
  music → Music Video
  liveAction → Live Action
  other → Other
```

### STEP 4: OFFLINE URL PROCESSING (Comprehensive Expansion)

**Cross-Reference Optimization**:
1. **Check Existing Sources First**: Before processing URLs, check if anime already exists in:
   - Jikan relations (MAL URLs)
   - AnimePlanet relations (AnimePlanet URLs)
   - Skip processing URLs that already exist in structured data to avoid duplicate work

**Platform Coverage Strategy** (80% Coverage Achieved):
```yaml
WebFetch Compatible (Direct Access):
  - MyAnimeList: Direct WebFetch support
  - AnimePlanet: Direct WebFetch support  
  - AniDB: Direct WebFetch support
  - Kitsu: Direct WebFetch support
  - Trakt: Direct WebFetch support
  - TheTVDB: Direct WebFetch support

Helper-Required Platforms (Anti-Bot Protection):
  - AniSearch: Use anisearch_url_helper.py (custom headers)
  - Simkl: Use simkl_url_helper.py (cloudscraper + dead entry detection)

Unsupported (Manual Review Required):
  - LiveChart: Complex anti-bot protection
  - Notify.moe: Requires authentication
```

**Smart Title Extraction**:
1. **URL Slug Parsing**: Extract from meaningful URL slugs
   - `https://anime-planet.com/anime/one-piece-film-red` → "One Piece Film Red"
   - `https://kitsu.app/anime/cowboy-bebop` → "Cowboy Bebop"

2. **Platform-Specific Processing**:
   ```yaml
   WebFetch Platforms:
     - Use WebFetch tool directly for content extraction
     - Extract title from page metadata (og:title, h1, title tag)
     - Extract rich context for AI relationship inference
   
   AniSearch URLs:
     - Use anisearch_url_helper.fetch_anisearch_url_data()
     - Leverages MODB's proven header strategy: {"host": "www.anisearch.com"}
     - Returns structured data with title and context for AI analysis
   
   Simkl URLs:
     - Use simkl_url_helper.fetch_simkl_url_data()
     - Uses cloudscraper to bypass Cloudflare protection
     - Implements MODB's dead entry detection pattern
     - Returns None for dead entries, context data for valid entries
   
   Fallback (Numeric IDs):
     - Extract from URL path: /anime/123456 → "Platform Anime 123456"
     - Mark with low confidence for manual review
   ```

**AI-Powered Relationship Inference**:
- **Primary Strategy**: Extract rich context from pages and let AI infer relationships
- **Context Sources**: Page titles, descriptions, metadata, genre information, related sections
- **Avoid Hardcoded Patterns**: No regex-based relationship detection (prevents false positives)
- **Confidence Scoring**: High (extracted title + context), Medium (slug-based), Low (ID-only)

**Dead Entry Handling**:
- **Simkl Dead Detection**: Check for MODB's pattern: `'<meta property="og:title" content="Simkl - Watch and Track Movies, Anime, TV Shows" />'`
- **General 404 Handling**: WebFetch failures → skip URL rather than create low-quality entries
- **Manual Review Flagging**: Mark failed extractions for human verification

### STEP 5: INTELLIGENT DEDUPLICATION

**URL-Based Deduplication Strategy**:

1. **Primary Deduplication Rule**: Use URL as the main deduplication key
   - **Same URL** → Deduplicate (same anime entry, just categorized differently by sources)
   - **Different URL** → Keep both (valuable cross-platform references)

2. **URL-Based Grouping**:
   ```yaml
   Process:
     1. Group all entries by URL
     2. For each URL group with multiple entries:
        - Use priority hierarchy to select best relationship type
        - Keep only one entry per URL
     3. Preserve all entries with unique URLs
   ```

3. **Cross-Platform Preservation**: Different URLs = Different Platform References
   ```yaml
   Example - Keep Both (Different URLs):
     - title: "Attack on Titan Season 2", url: "myanimelist.net/anime/25777", relationship: "Sequel"
     - title: "Attack on Titan Season 2", url: "anime-planet.com/anime/attack-on-titan-season-2", relationship: "Movie"
   
   Reason: Different URLs = Different valuable platform references
   
   Example - Deduplicate (Same URL):
     - url: "myanimelist.net/anime/123", relationship: "Side Story" (Jikan)
     - url: "myanimelist.net/anime/123", relationship: "Movie" (AnimePlanet)
   
   Result: Keep AnimePlanet "Movie" (higher quality relationship type)
   ```

**Priority Hierarchy** (when same URL has multiple relationship types):
1. **Jikan** (comprehensive relationship types, manga support)
2. **AnimePlanet** (granular subtypes, complete metadata) 
3. **AnimSchedule** (validation source, gap-filling)
4. **Offline URLs** (expansion source, lowest priority)

**Type Selection Priority** (when same URL has conflicting relationship types):
- Always prefer specific types (Movie, OVA, Special) over generic (Side Story, Other)
- Maintain AnimePlanet granularity when available
- Use source priority hierarchy when relationship quality is equal

### STEP 6: QUALITY VALIDATION

**Completeness Checks**:
- Ensure all Jikan relations are preserved (primary source completeness)
- Ensure all AnimePlanet relations are preserved (co-primary source)
- Validate AnimSchedule route conversions for supplementary data
- Report offline URLs that couldn't be processed for expansion

**Consistency Validation**:
- Standardize relationship types across sources
- Validate URL accessibility and format correctness
- Check for logical relationship consistency (no circular references)

**Data Quality Scoring**:
- **High Quality**: Complete title, URL, and specific relationship type (Movie, OVA, Special, etc.)
- **Medium Quality**: Complete title, URL, but generic relationship type (Side Story, Other)  
- **Low Quality**: Generic title or missing/unknown relationship type

**Type Quality Hierarchy** (Prefer Higher Quality):
```yaml
Specific Types (High Quality):
  - Movie, OVA, Special, Music Video, Live Action
  - Sequel, Prequel, Spin-off, Character
  - Alternative Version, Adaptation

Generic Types (Medium Quality):  
  - Side Story, Parent Story, Full Story, Summary

Fallback Types (Low Quality):
  - Other
```

## OUTPUT SCHEMA

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "relatedAnime": [
    {{
      "title": "Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira",
      "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5/Cowboy_Bebop__Tengoku_no_Tobira",
      "relationship": "Side Story"
    }}
  ],
  "relations": [
    {{
      "title": "Cowboy Bebop",
      "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/173/Cowboy_Bebop", 
      "relationship": "Adaptation"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

## IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### OFFLINE URL PROCESSING SEQUENCE
```yaml
For each offline URL:
  1. Cross-Reference Check:
     - Skip if URL already exists in Jikan/AnimePlanet data
     - Avoid duplicate processing of same anime entries
  
  2. Platform Detection:
     - Extract domain from URL
     - Route to appropriate processing method
  
  3. Content Extraction:
     WebFetch Platforms (myanimelist.net, anime-planet.com, anidb.net, kitsu.app, trakt.tv, thetvdb.com):
       - Use WebFetch tool directly
       - Extract: og:title, h1, title tag, description, genre info
       - Parse rich context for AI relationship inference
     
     AniSearch URLs (anisearch.com):
       - Import: from src.batch_enrichment.anisearch_url_helper import fetch_anisearch_url_data
       - Call: result = fetch_anisearch_url_data(url)
       - Use result['title'] and result['context'] for processing
     
     Simkl URLs (simkl.com):
       - Import: from src.batch_enrichment.simkl_url_helper import fetch_simkl_url_data  
       - Call: result = fetch_simkl_url_data(url)
       - Handle dead entries: result['is_dead_entry'] == True → skip URL
       - Use result['title'] and result['context'] for processing
     
     Unsupported Platforms:
       - Extract title from URL slug if meaningful
       - Mark for manual review with low confidence
  
  4. Relationship Inference:
     - Use extracted context (description, genres, related sections) 
     - Apply AI analysis instead of hardcoded regex patterns
     - Assign confidence based on extraction quality
  
  5. Quality Scoring:
     - High: Full title + rich context extracted
     - Medium: Title from slug + basic context  
     - Low: Generic title or extraction failure
```

### HELPER FUNCTION INTEGRATION
```python
# AniSearch URL Processing
from src.batch_enrichment.anisearch_url_helper import fetch_anisearch_url_data
result = fetch_anisearch_url_data("https://anisearch.com/anime/302")
# Returns: {"title": str, "context": dict, "confidence": str, "source": "anisearch"}

# Simkl URL Processing  
from src.batch_enrichment.simkl_url_helper import fetch_simkl_url_data
result = fetch_simkl_url_data("https://simkl.com/anime/123456")
# Returns: {"title": str, "context": dict, "confidence": str, "is_dead_entry": bool}
```

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### DATA PROCESSING RULES
- **Jikan as Primary**: Process all Jikan relations first with highest priority
- **Cross-Reference Optimization**: Skip URLs already in structured data sources
- **Helper Function Integration**: Use platform-specific helpers for blocked sites
- **AI-Powered Inference**: Let AI analyze context instead of hardcoded patterns

### DEDUPLICATION REQUIREMENTS  
- **URL-Based Deduplication**: Use URL as primary deduplication key
- **Same URL Rule**: Same URL = same anime entry → deduplicate using priority hierarchy
- **Different URL Rule**: Different URL = different platform reference → keep both
- **Priority-Based Selection**: When same URL has multiple relationship types, use source priority + type quality

### OUTPUT VALIDATION
- **Complete Coverage**: All processable relationships included with 80% platform coverage
- **Quality Consistency**: Meaningful titles and relationship types only
- **URL Validity**: Well-formed URLs for all entries
- **Dead Entry Filtering**: Skip Simkl dead entries and failed extractions

**EXECUTION**: Process relationships using source hierarchy, helper functions, and AI-powered inference. Return ONLY the JSON result with no explanations.

**IMPORTANT**: Your response must be ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not explain your process or matching decisions. Return only the JSON object with the exact schema above.
