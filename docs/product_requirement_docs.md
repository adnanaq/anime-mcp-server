# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Anime MCP Server

## 1. Project Vision & Purpose

### Why This Project Exists

The Anime MCP Server exists to solve the **fragmented anime discovery problem** in the modern entertainment landscape. With anime content scattered across dozens of platforms, databases, and services, fans and developers face significant challenges:

1. **Platform Fragmentation**: Anime data exists in silos across MyAnimeList, AniList, Kitsu, AniDB, and numerous streaming services
2. **Poor Search Experience**: Basic text matching fails for nuanced anime discovery needs ("find me something similar to Attack on Titan but less violent")
3. **Lack of AI Integration**: No intelligent systems that understand user preferences and provide contextual recommendations
4. **Developer Barriers**: Complex APIs and inconsistent data formats make building anime applications difficult
5. **Missing Multimodal Search**: No unified system that can search by text, image, or combination of both

### Core Problems Solved

**For End Users:**
- **Intelligent Discovery**: Natural language queries that understand intent ("show me 5 mecha anime from 2020s but not too violent")
- **Multimodal Search**: Find anime by uploading images or combining text with visual similarity
- **Cross-Platform Data**: Unified access to data from 8+ anime platforms without managing multiple APIs
- **Real-Time Scheduling**: Current airing anime with broadcast schedules and streaming availability

**For Developers & AI Systems:**
- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Standardized Model Context Protocol for seamless AI assistant integration
- **Semantic Vector Search**: High-performance vector database with sub-200ms response times
- **Conversational Workflows**: LangGraph-powered intelligent conversation flows with memory
- **Unified REST API**: Single endpoint for complex anime operations instead of managing multiple services

**For AI Assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.):**
- **Natural Language Understanding**: AI-powered query parsing that extracts parameters from conversational text
- **Tool Integration**: 31 specialized MCP tools for different anime platforms and search types
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Multi-agent systems that intelligently route queries to optimal data sources
