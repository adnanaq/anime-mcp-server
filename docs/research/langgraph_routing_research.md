### 2. Multi-Agent Routing Systems

**Research Focus**: How to implement intelligent agent selection  
**Key Discoveries**:

- **State-Based Routing**: Decisions based on conversation state and context

**Implementation Patterns**:
```python
# Router Agent Pattern
class AnimeQueryRouter:
    def analyze_complexity(self, query: str) -> RouteDecision
    def select_agents(self, complexity: ComplexityScore) -> List[Agent]
    def orchestrate_workflow(self, agents: List[Agent]) -> Response
```

### 3. Conditional Routing and Decision Trees

**Research Focus**: How to implement smart routing logic  
**Key Patterns Found**:
- **Query Complexity Analysis**: LLM-powered intent detection
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Tier-based escalation (simple → complex)
- **Fallback Strategies**: Circuit breaker patterns for failed routes

**Decision Tree Architecture**:
```
Query → Complexity Analysis → Route Decision → Agent Selection → Tool Execution
```

### 4. Tool Routing and Selection Strategies

**Research Focus**: How to intelligently select tools from expanded tool set  
**Discoveries**:
- **Tool Categories**: Core tools, platform tools, enhancement tools
- **Selection Criteria**: Performance requirements, data freshness, cost optimization
- **Dynamic Tool Loading**: Runtime tool availability checking

**Tool Organization Strategy**:
- **7 Core Tools**: Offline database (maintain existing)
- **14 Platform Tools**: API-based enhancement
- **10 Enhancement Tools**: Cross-platform correlation

### 5. Performance Optimization Research

**Research Focus**: LangGraph 2024 performance improvements  
**Key Findings**:
- **ToolNode Optimization**: 20-30% speed improvements in tool execution
- **Memory Management**: Better state handling for long conversations
- **Concurrent Execution**: Parallel tool execution capabilities
- **Caching Strategies**: Route-based caching for repeated patterns

### 6. Circuit Breaker and Fallback Patterns

**Research Focus**: Reliability patterns for production systems  
**Patterns Identified**:
- **Health Check Integration**: Monitor external service availability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to offline data when APIs fail
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and success rates

## ADVANCED ROUTING PATTERNS DISCOVERED (Beyond If/Else)

### 1. **Send API for Dynamic Parallel Execution**
**Discovery**: LangGraph's Send API enables dynamic parallel workflow execution where "the number of subtasks may be unknown during graph design"
**Capability**: Distribute different states to multiple node instances in parallel
**Application**: Route to multiple platforms simultaneously based on query complexity

### 2. **Message-Passing State Machines**
**Discovery**: LangGraph uses message passing to define programs where "when a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s)"
**Capability**: Complex state transitions with parallel super-steps
**Application**: Multi-stage enhancement where each tier can trigger parallel processing

### 3. **Stateful Routing with Context Memory**
**Discovery**: "Stateful routing where every new request must be redirected to the last agent you've spoken to and the route is memorized in the graph state"
**Capability**: Context-aware routing that remembers successful patterns
**Application**: Learn which platforms work best for specific query types

### 4. **Command Objects for Dynamic Control Flow**
**Discovery**: "Returning a Command object from node functions offers dynamic control flow behavior identical to conditional edges"
**Capability**: Runtime routing decisions with state updates
**Application**: Adaptive routing that changes strategy based on real-time results

### 5. **Super-Step Parallel Execution Model**
**Discovery**: "Discrete 'super-steps' inspired by Google's Pregel system where nodes that run in parallel are part of the same super-step"
**Capability**: Transactional parallel execution with rollback capability
**Application**: Query multiple platforms in parallel with automatic failover

### 6. **Multi-Agent Swarm Architecture**
**Discovery**: "Swarm-style multi-agent systems where agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations"
**Capability**: Specialized agents that transfer context and control
**Application**: Platform-specific agents that hand off enhanced data

## REVISED ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS (Beyond If/Else)

### 1. **Send API Parallel Router** (Not Simple Router Layer)
**New Approach**: Use Send API to launch parallel queries across multiple platforms
**Implementation**: 
```python
# Instead of if/else logic:
def route_query(self, query: str) -> List[Send]:
    complexity = await self._analyze_complexity(query)
    parallel_routes = self._determine_parallel_routes(complexity)
    
    return [
        Send("mal_agent", {"query": query, "platform": "mal"}),
        Send("anilist_agent", {"query": query, "platform": "anilist"}),
        Send("offline_agent", {"query": query, "platform": "offline"})
    ]
```

### 2. **Super-Step Enhancement Strategy** (Not Sequential Tiers)
**New Approach**: Parallel super-steps with transactional execution
**Implementation**:
- **Super-Step 1**: Parallel offline + fast APIs (50-250ms)
- **Super-Step 2**: Parallel slow APIs + scraping (300-1000ms)  
- **Rollback Capability**: If any super-step fails, automatic fallback

### 3. **Swarm Agent Architecture** (Not Tool Expansion)
**New Approach**: Specialized agents with handoff capabilities
**Implementation**:
- **Platform Agents**: MAL Agent, AniList Agent, Jikan Agent
- **Enhancement Agents**: Rating Correlation Agent, Streaming Agent
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Manages handoffs and result merging

### 4. **Stateful Route Learning** (Not Simple Caching)
**New Approach**: Context-aware routing with conversation memory
**Implementation**: Remember which agent combinations work best for user preferences
