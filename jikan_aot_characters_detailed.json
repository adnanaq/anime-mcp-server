    "about": "Age: 16\nBirthday: June 16\nHeight: 178 cm (5'9\")\nWeight: 70 kg (154 lbs)\nAffiliations: 104th Trainees Squad, Scouting Legion\nGraduation Rank: 7th\n\nMarco Bott is a member of the 104th Trainees Squad, and graduated as the 7th ranked trainee in his class. He was assigned to fight the Titans after the breach of Wall Rose, and given command of his own squad. \n\nMarco is an idealistic person, valuing the good of the group above his own interests as well as understanding and coping with his own shortcomings and limitations. The others respected him greatly, and considered him to be a natural leader suited to his dreams of joining the Military Police. Unlike those who join the Military Police for safety and privileges, his reasons of joining it were genuinely faithful. He was shown to be an excellent judge of others, recognizing Jean's potential as a leader and encouraging him to believe in himself. He was also shown to have a talent for preserving order among the other trainees, whether resolving arguments or keeping them calm during battle.\n\nMarco is first introduced during the initiation of new recruits, and is intimidated by their instructor after expressing his desire to join the Military Police. He later attempts to maintain order when the recruits question Eren about the attack on Wall Maria, hiding the others when their questions become too upsetting. During his time as a trainee, he befriends Jean Kirschtein and the two were often seen together. He seems to have been one of the only people to recognize Jean's potential, encouraging him to embrace his natural abilities as a leader.\n\nAfter the Colossal Titan attacked Trost, Marco was assigned command of the 19th Trainee Squad and ordered to support the vanguard forces. He was eventually among the trainees stranded when the retreat order was given, without enough gas to scale the Wall and escape Trost. When Mikasa and Jean rally the others into charging headquarters, which had become surrounded by Titans, Marco is quick to join them. Inside the station, he became vital in Armin's plan to reclaim the overun supply room and leads the main group. Armed with rifles, the recruits acted as bait and lure the seven Titans occupying the room into position. Marco managed to maintain order in the group, keeping everyone calm until they could fire and blind the attacking Titans.\n\nHe is later seen among the regrouped forces, attempting to keep order when people like Dazz give into their fear. Marco did his best to comfort them and keep morale high, even when they were ordered to return to Trost. He joined the other recruits up on the Wall, acting as bait to distract the Titans from the main operation involving Eren Yeager. Later, he was among the recruits that head into the city to battle the Titans. There, he helped to rescue Jean when his gear malfunctioned and would eventually join the others in battling the Titans while Eren sealed the hole in Wall Rose. \n\n\nNote: Marco Bott is the official English translation by Kodansha.",

    "about": "Age: Unknown\nBirthday: September 5\nHeight: 170 cm (5'7\")\nWeight: 60 kg (132 lbs)\nAffiliations: Scouting Legion\n\nScouting Legion's Squad Leader.\n\nHange is very passionate and driven in pursuit of new knowledge. They can be seen as very hyperactive, often diving into projects without thought for personal safety (and frightening lots of subordinates in the process), instead preoccupied with observing and documenting the subjects. Some misunderstand these acts and Hange is seen as eccentric and having more than a few screws loose. They also enjoy discussing this research, but as the lectures can be very long and detail-oriented, not many fellow soldiers find them interesting.\n\nHange is often excited by Titans and is always eager to experiment with them, coming off as extremely emotional regarding titans. For example, they cry at the amount of pain being caused to a Titan during experimentation.",

She follows when Eren instructs the other trainees to attack the Colossal Titan. After the second attack of the Colossal Titan, she was assigned to the middle guard along with Eren Yeager and Armin Arlert. Initially tasked with working under the training corps, they eventually were incorporated into the front guard due to the number of titans. Catching the group unaware, a titan lunged at the roof top they were standing on. \n\nWhen Eren was talking about how killing titans that got in Trost District will get their rank up high, she joined him indicating that she is also signing up for Scouting Legion.",

When the Colossal Titan appears outside Trost District, the burst of steam from its body knocks a number of trainees off the Wall. While most are able to switch to their Three Dimensional Maneuver Gear and anchor themselves to the Wall, Samuel is struck in the head by a piece of falling rock and stunned. Sasha saves him from falling to his death by firing one of her grappling hooks into his leg. Eren tells Sasha to take Samuel somewhere safe, then instructs the other trainees to attack the Colossal Titan. \n\nAs Samuel has not been seen again since then, it is unknown whether he lived or died.\n\nFirst Appearance\nManga: Ch. 3 \"The Night Of The Disbanding\"\nAnime: Ep. 3 \"Shining Dimly in the Midst of Despair\"\n\n(Source: Attack on Titan Wiki)",
