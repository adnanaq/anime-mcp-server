# Anime MCP Server - Current Implementation Session

## Session Overview

**Date**: 2025-07-07  
**Task Type**: API Platform Separation - Complete  
**Status**: Ready for next development task

## Current Work Focus

**TASK #64**: MAL/Jikan API Client Separation - COMPLETED ✅

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Platform Architecture**: Successfully separated MAL API v2 (OAuth2, official) from Jikan API v4 (no-auth, unofficial scraper)
- **Service Priority**: Jikan prioritized over MAL due to no authentication requirement
- **Observability**: Unified error handling, correlation tracking, and tracing across both platforms
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test coverage with actual API calls through mapper system

## Recent Changes

### Implementation Results (Task #64)
- ✅ Created proper `MALClient` for official MAL API v2 with OAuth2
- ✅ Created clean `JikanClient` for Jikan API v4 (renamed from confused hybrid)
- ✅ Separated `MALService` and `JikanService` implementations  
- ✅ Updated ServiceManager to treat MAL and Jikan as separate platforms
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling, correlation, and tracing to both clients
- ✅ Comprehensive testing: 112 tests passing (100%) with actual API calls
- ✅ Documentation: Complete platform configuration guide and troubleshooting
- ✅ Cleanup: Removed old hybrid `mal_client_old.py` file

### Files Created/Updated
- `src/integrations/clients/mal_client.py` (proper MAL API v2)
- `src/integrations/clients/jikan_client.py` (clean Jikan API v4)  
- `src/services/external/mal_service.py` (updated for real MAL)
- `src/services/external/jikan_service.py` (new Jikan service)
- Comprehensive test suites for both platforms
- `docs/platform_configuration.md` (new configuration guide)
- Updated `tasks/tasks_plan.md`, `rules/lessons-learned.mdc`, `rules/error-documentation.mdc`

## Next Steps

**Development Readiness**: 
- MAL and Jikan platforms fully separated and tested
- ServiceManager updated with proper platform priorities
- Comprehensive observability infrastructure in place
- All documentation updated per project rules

**Awaiting**: User direction for next development priority from tasks backlog.
